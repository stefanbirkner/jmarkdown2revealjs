JMarkdown2RevealJs is a Java library that converts
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files to
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) presentations.
JMarkdown2RevealJs has been inspired by Ulf BÃ¶rgenholz'
[markdown2deckjs](https://github.com/ulf/markdown2deckjs).

if you want to use it with an earlier version of Java.

## Installation

JMarkdown2RevealJs is available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).

## Usage

### File Format

whenever it encounters an `h1` or `h2`. Here is an example file with
three slides.

    Title Slide
    ===========

    First Slide
    -----------

    content of first slide

    Second Slide
    ------------

    content of second slide

### Create the Presentation

    import com.github.stefanbirkner.jmarkdown2revealjs.*;

    String markdown = readMarkdown(); //your code that reads the markdown
    String revealJsHtml = new JMarkdown2RevealJs().convert(markdown);

JMarkdown2RevealJs uses relative URLs for the CSS and JavaScript files by
default. You can create HTML files with different URLs by providing a
configuration with a prefix for the URLs.

    import com.github.stefanbirkner.jmarkdown2revealjs.*;

    Configuration configuration = new Configuration("http://your.domain/");
    String markdown = readMarkdown(); //your code that reads the markdown
    String revealJsHtml = new JMarkdown2RevealJs(configuration).convert(markdown);
